**i. Assume that in your API call you received a 401 status code. Which part of your code most probably is not correct?**

If you receive a 401 status code in your API call, the most probable part of your code that is not correct is the authentication key provided in the request headers. In this specific scenario, you should double-check the 'X-RapidAPI-Key' in your request headers and ensure that it is a valid and authorized API key. A 401 status code indicates an unauthorized request, often due to an incorrect or invalid API key.

**ii. Explain your design choices and how you used CSS to realize those changes.**

In designing the web interface for this weather app, I made the following design choices and used CSS to realize these changes:

- **Font Selection**: I used the `Arial` font for the text to ensure readability and a clean look.

- **Background**: I set the background color to `#f0f0f0` for a neutral and visually pleasing background.

- **Text Alignment**: Text is centered using `text-align: center` to maintain a centered layout.

- **Margins**: I added margins to various elements to create spacing and improve the overall layout. For instance, I added a top margin of 20px to the `<h1>` element to separate it from the top of the page.

- **Form Styling**: I applied styling to the form elements, including labels, input fields, and the submit button. The input field has a border and padding for a clean and consistent look.

- **Button Styling**: The submit button has padding, a background color, and text color to make it stand out. Additionally, I added a top margin of 20px to provide separation from the input field.

- **Container Styling**: The weather data container has a background color, border, and padding to create a distinct visual section for displaying weather information.

- **Responsive Design**: While not explicitly mentioned, the CSS design should be responsive, ensuring that the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

These design choices were made to create a clean and user-friendly interface for the weather app. CSS was used to style the HTML elements, providing a visually appealing and organized user experience.

**Hosted on Render Free Tier**

The application is hosted on Render's free tier, which is a cost-effective way to deploy and host web applications. The free tier typically has limitations, such as monthly usage quotas and potential for sleeping the application during periods of inactivity. Make sure to monitor the usage and performance of your application on Render to ensure it remains within the free tier limits.
